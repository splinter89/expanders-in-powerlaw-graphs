First and foremost, I would like to express the deepest gratitude
to my senior supervisor Valentine Kabanets.
I recognize that this work would be impossible without him giving me
this opportunity and providing invaluable guidance along the way.
Valentine also introduced me to complexity theory beyond the P versus NP problem
and helped in exploring its deep connections to many other fields.
Now I have a feeling of great respect for this area and people who work in it.

I am thankful to my supervisor Andrei Bulatov for his support
and helpful advices on how to refine this thesis.
In addition, I would like to thank Bojan Mohar for agreeing to examine this thesis,
as well as Binay Bhattacharya for being the defence chair.

And to everyone who met me with hospitality and kindness~--- I appreciate that.
